# Simulink-Based-Autonomous-UAV-for-Traget-Tracking-and-Landing
A vision-guided UAV built with Simulink and deployed on a Parrot Mambo Minidrone to autonomously track and land on a moving target. Features include adaptive color thresholding, a sub-matrix-based vision algorithm for real-time tracking, and finely tuned flight control for stability and responsiveness. Developed in Spring 2025.
